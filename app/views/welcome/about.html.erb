          Game School was founded on the idea that anyone can learn to
          make Virtual Reality. We're game designers and self-taught
          coders, and we want to make the next generation of influencers
          in the world of Virtual Reality. There are tons of places that
          VR can go - from virtual tourism, to therapy, to training - and
          we want to help anyone who has an idea, to understand how to
          make it a (virtual) reality.
